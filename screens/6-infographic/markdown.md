# Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)

A *myocardial infarction* (MI), commonly known as a /heart attack/, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a [blood clot|blood-clot]. This blockage prevents oxygen from reaching the heart tissue, causing damage or death to that area of the [cardiac muscle|cardiac-muscle]. The condition represents one of the most serious [cardiovascular emergencies|cardiovascular-emergencies] and requires immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage or death.

## Understanding the Condition

![left|Diagram of heart with blocked artery](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628348068343-c6a848d2b6dd?w=400&q=80)

Myocardial infarction stands as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, affecting millions of people annually and representing a critical public health challenge. The heart muscle, known medically as the [myocardium|myocardium], requires a constant and uninterrupted supply of oxygen-rich blood to function properly and maintain its vital role in circulating blood throughout the body. When one or more of the [coronary arteries|coronary-arteries] becomes blocked, the affected heart tissue begins to die within minutes, initiating a cascade of potentially fatal events.

The severity and outcomes of a heart attack depend on multiple interconnected factors including the precise location of the blockage within the coronary circulation, the duration of blocked blood flow before treatment is initiated, the total amount of heart tissue affected by the [ischemia|ischemia], and critically, how quickly emergency treatment is received. Early recognition of symptoms and immediate medical intervention are absolutely critical for survival and can dramatically improve long-term recovery outcomes. According to the {American Heart Association|https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack}, prompt treatment within the first hour significantly reduces mortality and preserves heart function.

## Risk Factors

Understanding the risk factors for myocardial infarction is essential for both prevention and early intervention strategies. Risk factors fall into several distinct categories, each contributing differently to overall cardiovascular risk profiles.

| Category | Risk Factors |
|----------|-------------|
| *Modifiable* | Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet |
| *Non-modifiable* | Age (men ≥45, women ≥55), family history, previous heart attack |
| /Lifestyle/ | Excessive alcohol consumption, chronic stress, drug use |

*Modifiable risk factors* can be addressed through lifestyle changes and medical treatment. Smoking damages blood vessel linings and accelerates [atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]. High blood pressure strains the heart and damages arteries over time. Elevated [cholesterol|cholesterol] levels contribute to plaque buildup, while [diabetes|diabetes] damages blood vessels and nerves. Research published by the {National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart-attack} emphasizes that addressing modifiable risk factors can reduce heart attack incidence by up to 80%.

## Warning Signs & Symptoms

![right|Person clutching chest in pain](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584515933487-779824d29309?w=400&q=80)

Recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack can literally save lives, yet many people delay seeking help because they don't recognize what's happening or hope the symptoms will resolve on their own. Common symptoms include:

[[[
- *Chest discomfort* Pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest lasting more than a few minutes
- *Upper body pain* Discomfort in arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach
- *Shortness of breath* With or without chest discomfort
- *Cold sweat* Breaking out in a cold sweat
- *Nausea or lightheadedness* Feeling sick to your stomach or dizzy
]]]

### Atypical Symptoms

Women, elderly individuals, and people with [diabetes|diabetes] may experience what physicians call /atypical symptoms/ that differ from the classic presentation:

[[[
- Unusual fatigue
- Sleep disturbances
- Indigestion or stomach discomfort
- Anxiety or sense of impending doom
]]]

The {Mayo Clinic|https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106} notes that women are more likely than men to experience these atypical presentations.

*IMPORTANT* If you suspect a heart attack, call emergency services immediately by dialing 911 or your local emergency number. Do not attempt to drive yourself to the hospital, as your condition could deteriorate rapidly during transport, and emergency medical services can begin life-saving treatment en route to the hospital.

## Pathophysiology

![center|Cross-section showing atherosclerosis progression](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579154204601-01588f351e67?w=800&q=80)
/Progression of atherosclerosis leading to arterial blockage/

The most common cause of myocardial infarction is *coronary artery disease* (CAD), a chronic condition characterized by [atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis], which involves the progressive buildup of fatty deposits called [plaques|plaques] in the arterial walls. This process typically develops over many years or even decades before causing symptoms.

### The Process

[[[
1. *Plaque formation* Cholesterol and other substances accumulate in artery walls over years
2. *Plaque rupture* The plaque cap breaks, exposing the interior
3. *Clot formation* Platelets aggregate at the rupture site, forming a blood clot
4. *Arterial blockage* The clot grows and blocks blood flow
5. *Tissue death* Heart muscle cells begin dying within 20-40 minutes
]]]

Understanding this mechanism has led to revolutionary treatments targeting different stages of this process, as documented by the {World Health Organization|https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases} in their comprehensive cardiovascular disease guidelines.

## Types of Heart Attacks

Heart attacks are medically classified into two major categories based on [electrocardiogram|electrocardiogram] findings and the extent of arterial blockage, each requiring different treatment approaches and carrying different prognoses.

*ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)* represents a /complete blockage/ of a major coronary artery and constitutes the most severe type of heart attack requiring immediate emergency intervention. The characteristic ST-segment elevation visible on an electrocardiogram indicates transmural myocardial injury, meaning the damage extends through the full thickness of the heart wall. STEMI carries the highest risk of death and severe complications, making it a true medical emergency where every minute counts. The {American College of Cardiology|https://www.acc.org/guidelines} recommends emergency [percutaneous coronary intervention|percutaneous-coronary-intervention] within 90 minutes of first medical contact.

*Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)* involves a /partial blockage/ that still damages heart muscle but typically to a lesser extent than STEMI. The affected artery may be completely blocked distally, partially blocked, or have severely reduced blood flow due to a critical stenosis. While generally less immediately life-threatening than STEMI, NSTEMI still represents a serious cardiac event requiring prompt treatment and hospitalization. The absence of ST-elevation doesn't mean the heart attack is mild or can be taken lightly.

## Diagnosis

![left|ECG readout showing heart rhythm](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1631217868264-e5b90bb7e133?w=400&q=80)

Healthcare providers employ multiple diagnostic tests to confirm a heart attack diagnosis, assess the extent of damage, and guide treatment decisions:

[[[
- *Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)* Records electrical activity of the heart
- *Blood tests* Measure cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB) released when heart muscle is damaged
- *Coronary angiography* X-ray imaging with contrast dye to visualize blockages
- *Echocardiogram* Ultrasound showing heart pumping function
- *Cardiac CT or MRI* Detailed imaging of heart structure
]]]

---

## Emergency Treatment

*Time is muscle* - immediate treatment improves survival and reduces heart damage. Every minute of delay results in more heart muscle death.

### Initial Response

[[[
- *Call 911 immediately*
- Chew one adult aspirin (325 mg) if not allergic
- Rest and remain calm
- Take nitroglycerin if prescribed
]]]

### Hospital Interventions

| Treatment | Description | Timeframe |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| *Medications* | Clot-busting drugs (thrombolytics), antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants | Within 30-90 minutes |
| *Angioplasty & Stenting* | Catheter procedure to open blocked artery and insert stent | Within 90 minutes (door-to-balloon time) |
| /Coronary Artery Bypass/ | Surgical creation of new blood flow pathway around blockage | When angioplasty not suitable |

Research from the {European Society of Cardiology|https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines} demonstrates that achieving these time targets significantly reduces mortality and preserves left ventricular function.

Recovery from a heart attack involves both physical healing and lifestyle modifications:

### Cardiac Rehabilitation Program

A comprehensive program including:

[[[
- *Medical evaluation* Regular monitoring by healthcare team
- *Physical activity counseling* Gradual increase in exercise under supervision
- *Education* Understanding heart disease and risk reduction
- *Counseling* Managing stress, anxiety, and depression
]]]

### Lifestyle Modifications

[[[
- Adopt a heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean diet, DASH diet)
- Engage in regular physical activity (150 minutes/week moderate exercise)
- Quit smoking completely
- Maintain healthy weight
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Take medications as prescribed
]]]

---

## Medications for Long-term Management

After a heart attack, patients typically need lifelong medications:

[[[
- *Antiplatelet agents* (aspirin, clopidogrel) Prevent blood clots
- *Beta-blockers* Reduce heart workload and blood pressure
- *ACE inhibitors or ARBs* Improve heart function and lower blood pressure
- *Statins* Lower cholesterol levels
- *Nitrates* Relieve chest pain by dilating blood vessels
]]]

Medication adherence remains crucial for long-term outcomes, as discontinuing these medications significantly increases the risk of recurrent cardiac events and death.
